title: Kuryr review
---
Please assess:

A. Will the planned ShiftStack implementation cause regressions on clusters running on Kuryr?

B. Does this feature need additional work to function on clusters running on Kuryr?

Please add your considerations as comments below, and move this card to "Code Review" once the assessment is complete.

Please move this card to "Done" once all the corrective actions are complete (e.g. once a new Jira card has been created for each suggested action).
